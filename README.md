# mancala

This project involves a command-line Mancala game coded in Python.  

The construction of the basic game code is described in a series of YouTube videos available here:

The Python file named "mancala_tutorial_reference_version.py" stores the complete code described in the tutorial video series.  It is intended to serve as a fixed reference.


Goals for this project include adding the option to play against the computer and perhaps using a series of randomized games as a way for the computer to "learn" to play the game.
